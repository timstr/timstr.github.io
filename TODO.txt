Timâ€™s Pancake Recipe
===
What:
- 2 cups flour
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 2 cups milk
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp maple syrup
- 2 tbsp molten butter
- 0.5 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
How:
- Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl.
- Whisk together milk, eggs, maple syrup, and optional vanilla extract in a medium bowl.
- Pour liquid mixture into powder mixture and gently whisk until smooth.
- Heat a large flat pan or gridle on medium-high heat and grease with butter.
- When pan is hot, pour out batter in approximately 1/4 cup scoops onto hot surface. Pour the batter onto the same spot without moving to create nice round pancakes.
- Once the surface of each pancake has produced small bubbles and those bubbles begin to stay open instead of closing over, flip the pancakes and fry for another minute or two.
- Remove the pancakes from the pan and keep warm. Continue to fry the rest of the batter using the same method. Periodically add butter to the pan between batches. If the pan fills with crumbs or burnt butter, very carefully wipe out the pan with a paper towel and add fresh butter before frying the next batch. If the pan begins to smoke, lower the heat.
- Serve the pancakes warm with your choice of maple syrup, nutella, fresh fruit, jam, compote, cinnamon sugar, apple sauce, or whatever you prefer.
