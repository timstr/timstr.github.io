                    <p>
                        Over the course of many dull highschool classes, I taught myself
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC">TI-BASIC</a> which is a
                        weird and terrible language, although it does let you manipulate individual
                        pixels of the screen. I made a drawing program that consists of the cursor,
                        which is a single flashing pixel, that can be moved one pixel at a time
                        using the arrow keys, and whose colour can be toggled with the Enter key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important part of this program is a series of for-loops that do nothing
                        other than slow the interpreter down enough for the key press speed to
                        roughly match human intuition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This extremely restricted medium combined with hours of classroom boredom
                        made for some happy artwork.

                        TI-BASIC also has built-in support for complex numbers, which is convenient
                        for rendering the Mandelbrot set. The 96-by-64 pixel image shown here took
                        half an hour to render on this bad boy.
