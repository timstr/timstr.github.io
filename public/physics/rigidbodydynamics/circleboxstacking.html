                    <h1>Stacking Circles and Boxes</h1>
                    <p>
                        Here we see a random assortment of circles and rectangles placed in a
                        uniform rectangular grid. Each wall is an additional immoveable rectangle.
                        Detected collisions are illustrated using a combination of small blue lines
                        pointing along the collision normal, as well as red circles whose radii are
                        proportional to the collision depths.
                    </p>

                        Visualizing collisions and their properties like this was extremely helpful
                        during debugging, and I strongly recommend doing so to anyone writing their
                        own simulator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that when two rectangles collide along an entire edge, there are a
                        total of two collisions detected at both ends of the colliding region. This
                        design choice, allowing multiple collisions between pairs of bodies, leads
                        to greatly improved stability when using the Sequential Impulses Method.
                        Otherwise, one needs to find a single point along the colliding edges at
                        which to place a correcting impulse, and all my best attempts to do this
                        resulted in unstable oscillations. With multiple collision points, it
                        becomes far more natural to support edge-edge collisions while remaining
                        stable.

                        The obstacles here eventually fall, not because of instabilities or
                        inaccuracies in the simulation, but because of random initial offsets that
                        were deliberately added during positioning. Without these offsets, the
                        obstacles come to a rest without falling.
