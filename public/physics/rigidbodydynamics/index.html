                        Shown above is a screen capture from my rigid body dynamics simulator,
                        written in C++. The simulator allows arbitrary convex polygons to move and
                        collide in 2D space.

                    <p>
                        Collisions and joints are supported. The simulation engine relies on an
                        iterative local solver which solves constraints such as non-penetration and
                        fixed-distance constraints at the level of impulses. Working at the level of
                        impulses uses only the first time derivative, and using a local solver
                        allows for a much simpler implementation for things like inequality
                        constraints.

                        Other features include friction, immoveable solids, post-stabilization, and
                        the ability to apply arbitrary forces and impulses, which is useful for a
                        physics-based video game.

                        This engine is heavily inspired by the Sequential Impulses Method proposed
                        by Erin Catto, author of the popular
                        <a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D Physics Library</a>. Erin Catto has
                        published a number of highly informative resources at the
                        <a href="https://box2d.org/publications/">Box2D website</a>
                        for physics programming which I am grateful for.

                        which, while working at the level of forces and focusing on the second time
                        derivative, is very useful for thinking about constraints geometrically and
                        mathematically.
