                    <h1>Friction Demo</h1>
                    <p>
                        When using global solvers and when working at the level of forces,
                        implementing friction poses a signficant challenge. However, in a local,
                        impulse-based solver such as this one, friction can be implemented rather
                        naively with accurate and pleasing results.

                        Using the Sequential Impulses Method, implementing friction is as simple as
                        looping over all collision constraints and applying additional impulses
                        against the direction of tangent motion, proportional to the coefficient of
                        friction. These impulses must be clamped, such that they at most cancel the
                        tangent motion, rather than possibly reversing it.

                        In this demo, a series of obstacles collide without friction. Then, friction
                        is enabled, and the simulation is repeated.
