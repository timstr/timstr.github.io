                    <h2>How it works</h2>
                    <p>
                        Path tracing, like conventional computer rendering, draws 3D objects as seen by a virtual camera
                        by finding where lines of sight from the camera intersect with nearby objects. Unlike
                        conventional rendering, when a ray of light hits an obstacle, path tracing simulates multiple
                        additional bouncing rays which contribute light to the original point that was hit. Path tracing
                        is able to faithfully reproduce many real-world phenomena, such as global illumination, depth of
                        field, caustics, and a large variety of material properties. The recursive nature of path
                        tracing, as well as the large number of simulated rays per pixel that are needed for smooth
                        images, can make a naive implementation of a path tracer quite slow.
                    </p>

                        <imageicon

                            dst="/static/img/pathtracing/blockball09.png"
                        />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My implementation of a path tracer is of the naive variety, and so it converges very slowly for
                        scenes with very few, small, bright light sources (which unfortunately describes most natural
                        scenes). Most of the images you'll see here are flooded with light and light-emitting surfaces,
                        which converges more quickly and gives a delightfully other-wordly if not quite realistic look.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simple representation of light rays bouncing off surfaces that path tracing uses makes it
                        remarkably easy to implement a large number of pleasing optical effects with simple vector
                        calculus, including
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specular reflections</li>
                        <li>Diffuse reflections</li>
                        <li>Glossy reflections</li>
                        <li>Refraction</li>
                        <li>Caustics</li>
                        <li>Depth of field</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>among others.</p>
                    <p>
                        My pather tracer is designed to be fairly agnostic to the geometric representations of objects
                        it's rendering, as long as one can find points of intersections with rays and surface normals.
                        At the moment, rectangular prisms, spheres, triangles, and signed distance fields are
                        implemented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In natural scenes, most of the computation of a path tracer is wasted by naively gathering light
                        rays from dark areas, without giving direct and indirect light sources the extra attention they
                        deserve. Building a better path tracer requires a good understanding of efficient probabilistic
                        sampling that still remains accurate (or "unbiased"). I may attempt this in the future. But in
                        the meantime, here are some pretty pictures.

                        Whenever a ray hits a surface, the light that is seen along that ray is gathered from three
                        different major sources:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Light emitted by the surface itself, such as a light source or incandescing object</li>
                        <li>Rays that bounce off the surface and hit other light sources, which is reflection</li>
                        <li>
                            Rays that pass through the surface before later leaving and hitting other light sources,
                            which is refraction
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Just about any physical material can be described by how it transmits, reflects, and refracts
                        light according to where the material was hit, what angle it was hit at, and where other light
                        sources are located relatively.

                        Specular (or shiny) surfaces reflect incoming rays perfectly, which creates a crisp and detailed
                        reflection. Diffuse (or matte) surfaces will randomly bounce rays in many different directions,
                        which creates smooth and gradual shading.
                    </p>

                        <imageicon

                        Glossy materials produce a mixture of both specular and diffuse reflections. In the real world,
                        glossy or diffuse materials often appear to become shinier at oblique angles. This easy to
                        emulate in software, by attenuating the spread of diffuse reflections according to the incoming
                        angle.

                    <p>
                        Refraction is also fairly easy to implement, simply by allowing ray intersections to work
                        through the insides of obstacles. The amount that light rays are bent according to the indicies
                        of refraction is easily implemented using Snell's law. Slight specular highlights can be
                        obtained simply by randomly choosing some light rays to reflect while allowing the rest to
                        refract.

                <sectionbody>
                    <h2>What are caustics?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Caustics are when light from a single source is concentrated in a small spot from reflections
                        and refractions, rather than spreading out normally. Real-world examples include the patterns of
                        light behind glasses of water, the spots of light from a disco ball, and the ripples of light
                        under a wavy water surface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a path tracer, caustics are hard because they depend heavily on tiny light sources that are
                        very difficult to hit with random sampling. They also depend on indirect and often convoluted
                        sequences of light bounces, which makes reasoning about probabilistic sampling even more
                        difficult. For these reason, they're often used as a sort of benchmark for how well a path
                        tracer performs.

                        As has previously been stated, my path tracer is a naive implementation. The above image of a
                        sphere of glass focusing light onto a plane was rendered at 65,536 samples per pixel which took
                        forever. For this reason, I am not attempting to do any other work producing caustics here.

                <sectionbody>
                    <p>
                        My path tracer allows simple geometric solids and signed distance fields to coexist in the same
                        scene. Signed distance fields are fun because while they can describe simple shapes, they can
                        also be used to render fractals, such as the mandelbulb, on the fly. Ray intersect tests are
                        performed using ray marching, and surface normals are computed using finite differences. The
                        same materials used on basic shapes above can also be used here, at no extra cost.

                        On the top is a normal light source. When light rays hit the light source, their brightness
                        increases. On the bottom is a negative light source (or "light sink") which decreases the amount
                        of light returned by a bouncing light ray.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It makes no sense at all but the math is the same and it's fun to look at. Note the brighter
                        shadows and brighter corners (negative ambient occlusion) near the bottom of the image.
