                        Flosion is an ongoing project, and has been for a few years now. Consequently, the code base has
                        been through many major overhauls, and the user interface has also changed a number of times,
                        and is changing yet again as part of a current code update. The abstract structure has remained
                        the same for a long time though, and so the various screenshots here are still very relevant.

                        This screenshot is of an early version of Flosion, and shows, at the top, two numeric constants,
                        X and Y, being passed to an "Add" number object, which can be seen computing their sum. Below
                        that is another variable, "X Domain," being passed through a "Sine" object, and into a graphing
                        object. Graphing objects were a very useful feature that unfortunately were implemented in a
                        very unsafe and messy way, and ways to reintroduce them are under investigation. At the bottom
                        of the image, there is the object labeled "Aaah.wav," which is simply a sound object that plays
                        a sound file. This object is fed into the "PlayBack" object, which simply takes the sound stream
                        entering its input and plays the stream to the computer's speakers. The result is that one can
                        physically hear a recording of myself shouting.

                        If the font looks weird, it's probably because the glyphs were hand drawn by myself, using a
                        pixel art program that I also wrote myself to animate video game characters, all because I
                        couldn't figure out how to use standard text rendering APIs. But that's a different story from
                        my earlier days as a programmer.

                            In this example, a Filter object is used, which computes a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">fast Fourier transform</a>
                            of its input sound to create a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a>
                            . This spectrogram can be used to see how the sound is composed of a distribution of waves
                            of different frequencies and amplitudes. The Filter object can be used to amplify or
                            attenuate these frequencies selectively. It exposes a "frequency" number source at its top,
                            which it can change to select a frequency, and it provides an "amplitude" number input,
                            which it multiplies individual frequencies by. To modify individual frequencies, one simply
                            needs to define a function of the Filter's frequency and pass it into the "amplitude" input.
                            In this screenshot, a bell curve, or Gaussian distribution, is used to silence all but a
                            narrow range of frequency components. The overall result is that a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-pass_filter">band-pass filter</a> is applied to
                            the sound stream. Band-pass filters are a fairly common effect in digital music production,
                            and can be used for things like isolating vocals or bass from a larger piece of audio.

                        <p>
                            Here, we see a NoteGen object being used. This object is essentially a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_generator">function generator</a>, which
                            produces some periodic signal at a specified frequency. The NoteGen object exposes a "phase"
                            number output, visible on its top edge, and accepts a "wave function" input. By defining the
                            wave function input to be any desirable function of the phase, the user can create any wave
                            form they choose. The wave function chose here is the canonical sine wave.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The frequency at which this wave form is played in the output sound is determined by the
                            "frequency" number input, which is being given the constant value of 250 Hz here. The end
                            result of this setup is a simple sine-wave tone of 250 Hz.

                            Here, the NoteGen object is used in tandem with the Sampler object. The Sampler object is
                            used to define a melody. The vertical axis denotes note pitch, and the horizontal axis
                            denotes time. Essentially, it represents sheet music, but without all the swirls and lines
                            and other complex rules. The Sampler uses a multi-input so that it can call upon its input
                            many times in parallel, which it needs to do when its notes overlap in time. The Sampler
                            object also exposes a "note frequency" number output, which simply yields the value of the
                            current note's frequency. By plugging this into the NoteGen's frequency input, it produces a
                            note of the desired pitch. This example thus plays a sine-wave melody which is defined by
                            the notes drawn on the Sampler object.

                        Here's what it can look like when bigger networks of sounds and numbers are put together. It can
                        get messy quickly, which is why the next major version of Flosion will include new ways to
                        encapsulate sub-networks and hide the small details when needed.

                        In previous versions where graphing objects still existed, 2D graphing objects could also be
                        used, and were very useful for visualizing multi-dimensional things like filter functions that
                        changed over time.

                <sectionbody>
                    <p>
                        In more recent versions of Flosion, I've been working to allow the notes of a Sampler object to
                        be far more customizable than those of comparable note sequencers in other music software.
                        Firstly, notes can change frequency on the fly, as shown in the first example. Second, notes can
                        be parameterized by adding any number of numeric values that change as desired over the course
                        of the note's lifetime. These parameters are very useful for creating truly customized melodies
                        and effects, and help to give back some creative freedoms, like dynamically modifying the timbre
                        of instrument, which is otherwise lost when making music on a computer.
