                        This piece was created using the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_vocoder">Phase Vocoder</a> object. The original
                        sound is a 5-second exerpt from "Black Sands" by Bonobo, has been stretched in time to nearly 15
                        minutes, while preserving frequencies.

                        This piece demonstrates the use of the Resampler object, which performs
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample-rate_conversion">sample-rate conversion</a> to
                        change the speed and frequency of an audio stream. The Resampler object exposes a "speed" number
                        input, which in this example, is being changed by a simpler slider control.

                        Here, the FeedBack object was used, which was an experimental attempt to introduce a closed loop
                        into the audio rendering network. This can be used to allow methods like

                        >, and other effects like echoes and reverberations, as heard here. The original song is "Sprout
                        and the Bean" by Joanna Newsom.

                <!-- a lesson in FM synthesis -->
                <div class="songbox">
                    <soundcloudplayer width="500" height="200" trackid="271523671" />
                    <p>
                        Aptly named, this song demonstrates
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis"
                            >frequency modulation synthesis</a
                        >
                        . In FM synthesis, the frequency of a waveform being played is modulated at a speed comparable
                        to that of the waveform's original frequency. This method can achieve a variety of glassy,
                        metallic and ceramic sounds by changing the waveform and frequencies involved. The creation of
                        this sound involved only a Sampler object and a NoteGen object, plus a variety of number objects
                        to compute the waveforms and modulating functions.
                    </p>

                <!-- sauntering through many different waveforms -->
                <div class="songbox">
                    <soundcloudplayer width="500" height="200" trackid="315647927" />
                    <p>
                        Here, a NoteGen object is used in conjunction with a hand-drawn waveform to implement a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavetable_synthesis">wavetable synthesizer.</a>
                        . The timbre of the sound changing is due to the waveform being redrawn, freehandedly, at
                        runtime, by the user. Hand-drawn waveforms turn out to be a very effective way of introducing
                        unique timbres and harmonics. In most off-the-shelf synthesizers, the waveform is typically
                        selected from an immutable list of predefined shapes, but in Flosion, there is no such
                        restriction.
                    </p>

                <!-- sentimental saunter -->
                <div class="songbox">
                    <soundcloudplayer width="500" height="200" trackid="267075861" />
                    <p>
                        This piece was also made with a hand-drawn wavetable synthesizer. The output of this single-wave
                        synthesizer is then passed to an Ensemble object, which samples its input many times in parallel
                        while providing a random distribution of similar frequencies, and mixes the resulting streams
                        into a single output stream. This adds a tremendous amount of character and spatial immersion to
                        the synthesizer. The resulting sound stream is then passed through a Filter object which applies
                        a band-pass filter. At the start of every note, the filter permits most frequencies through,
                        before descending quickly to allow only bass frequencies. This changes the otherwise rather
                        static sound into something resembling a plucked or struck instrument. In other synthesizers,
                        this is commonly achieved by customizing something called the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#Attack_Decay_Sustain_Release_(ADSR)_envelope"
                            >Attack Decay Sustain Release envelope</a
                        >
                        and a filter which is built in to the synth. In Flosion, this is instead achieved by defining
                        arbitrary functions and wiring them together with Filter objects.
