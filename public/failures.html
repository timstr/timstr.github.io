                <h2>Papers I Did Not Publish</h2>
                <h3>Wave Simulation for Rapid Prototyping of Learned Acoustic Scene
                    Reconstruction (SIGGRAPH 2021)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reviewer 1.</strong> "The paper is not fully in the scope of Siggraph in its current form
                    and
                    its
                    interest for the Siggraph community appears to be limited [...]" <em>Reject (-3)</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reviewer 2.</strong> "I believe the work is not appropriate for SIGGRAPH". <emp>Reject (-3)
                    </emp>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reviewer 3.</strong> "[...] what you are simulating is too ideal." <em>Borderline reject
                        (-1)</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reviewer 4.</strong> "I have to say that I have many doubts about the proposed simulation
                    technique." <em>Reject (-3)</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reviewer 5.</strong> "The paper makes a really weak case for publishing at SIGGRAPH. How is
                    the
                    work
                    in the graphics community even related to this contribution? There are many possible answers here,
                    e.g.,
                    geometric reconstruction, but no attempt is made to connect with that related work to make a better
                    case
                    for
                    considering this paper." <em>Strong reject (-5)</em>
