                        Before the Covid-19 pandemic, my friends and I would often get together to
                        play
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu">Ti Chu</a>, or Tai Pan, which
                        is my favourite card game that I've ever played. When the pandemic came, we
                        suddenly had no way to play anymore. We had heard of various platforms for
                        playing card games online, but they seemed expensive or unsatisfactory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, drawing upon my experience in Full-Stack Web Development, I created a
                        web-app from scratch so we could keep playing cards. The web-app lives at
                        <a href="https://timstaipanserver.ca">timstaipanserver.ca</a>, but is
                        password-protected.

                    <p>
                        Both the front-end and back-end are written TypeScript. The front-end uses
                        React for rendering the user interface, and the back-end runs on Node. The
                        two ends communicate using websockets for maximum interactivity. The server
                        is hosted using Amazon Web Services and HTTPS certification is kindly
                        provided by
                        <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The full source code is available on
                        <a href="https://github.com/timstr/taipan-webapp">GitHub</a>. You are
                        welcome to fork the project and make your own card games.

                        <h4>Design Considerations</h4>
                        <p>
                            The web-app has a fairly minimal understanding of the rules of gameplay,
                            and relies on the players being able to hear each others' voices over a
                            separate phone call. This was a deliberate choice. Putting the players'
                            voices first rather than the controls of the UI keeps the gameplay
                            natural and social, especially when we lose several minutes at a time to
                            story-telling and jokes.
                        </p>
