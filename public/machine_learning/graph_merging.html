                        Many neural network models have been proposed that operate directly on graph data structures.
                        Existing methods are able to produce per-node feature embeddings for classification and
                        regression and differ mainly in the methods by which they pass messages and gather features from
                        node neighbourhoods. While learning from graph topology in this way has been explored well, the
                        process of learning to modify graph topology in a semantically meaningful manner has received
                        less attention. This work explores learnable reductions of graph topology by augmenting
                        conventional graph representations and graph network models with the ability to merges together,
                        while remaining fully-differentiable. The resulting framework is able to learn image
                        segmentation using only merge operations, and is theoretically applicable to a large variety of
                        problem domains where semantic reduction of graph data is desired.
