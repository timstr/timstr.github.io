                        Navigating and sensing the world through echolocation in air is an innate ability in many
                        animals for which analogous human technologies remain rudimentary. Many engineered approaches to
                        acoustic reconstruction have been devised which typically require unwieldy equipment and a
                        lengthy measurement process, and are largely not applicable in air or in everyday human
                        environments. Recent learning-based approaches to single-emission in-air acoustic reconstruction
                        use simplified hardware and an experimentally-acquired dataset of echoes and the geometry that
                        produced them to train models to predict novel geometry from similar but previously-unheard
                        echoes. However, these learned approaches use spatially-dense representations and attempt to
                        predict an entire scene all at once. Doing so requires a tremendous abundance of training
                        examples in order to learn a model that generalizes, which leaves these techniques vulnerable to
                        over-fitting.

                        We introduce an implicit representation for learned in-air acoustic reconstruction inspired by
                        synthetic aperture focusing techniques. Our method trains a neural network to relate the
                        coherency of multiple spatially-separated echo signals, after accounting for the expected
                        time-of-flight along a straight-line path, to the presence or absence of an acoustically
                        reflective object at any sampling location. Additionally, we use signed distance fields to
                        represent geometric predictions which provide a better-behaved training signal and allow for
                        efficient 3D rendering. Using acoustic wave simulation, we show that our method yields better
                        generalization and behaves more intuitively than competing methods while requiring only a small
                        fraction of the amount of training data.
